# otp_verification_
I have created an application for the task of OTP verification using Python. We have used tkinter and smtplib module to develop OTP Verification GUI.

The steps are mentioned below :

First, create a 6-digit random number.

Then store the number in a variable.

Then we need to write a program to send emails.

When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message.

Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the userâ€™s email and then for the OTP that the user has received.
